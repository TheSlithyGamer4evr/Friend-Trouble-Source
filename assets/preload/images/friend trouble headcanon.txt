"The Friend Trouble HeadCanon (By NinoTron): 
It was a Friday night afternoon as anyother day in smaller streams except when 
Theotherhand was about to announce his biggest project yet, a finished game of Five Nights At 
Blocky's only to get ignored when slithy introduced his Friday Night Funkin' mod that we was 
currently working on. Filled with rage and anger Theotherhand killed PunMaster,Slithy, and 
NinoTron. Cakie hearing the news thought nothing of it and went to go "Rap Battle" with 
Theotherhand, only if Cakie knew what he was about to get into."
